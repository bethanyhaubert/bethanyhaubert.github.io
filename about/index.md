Beth is a software engineer who loves Ruby, little-known APIs, handcrafting SQL queries, and as many monitors on her desk as possible.

She’s also a former airborne cryptologic linguist for the US Air Force, fluent in Mandarin. Things you can ask her about include Ruby, cats, board games, karaoke, and building applications that convert songs into auto-tuned cat meows. Things she'll have to kill you if you ask her about: the airborne linguist part. Also, she likes to make emojis look like they're farting. 🐈💨
