After a couple of false starts, I was finally able to make a bit of progress on the junior-devs-only Flywheel project. I've created about a dozen issues. I've updated the README, installed Rspec, set up Travis CI and CodeClimate to run automatically on GitHub. I still feel like there's so much more to do before people start working on it. I need to create some wireframes for the different views and the GitHub issues to go along with them. Since we don't have a designer on the projecAt, Michael recommended we use Bootstrap. I'm hoping it's easier to use than what I remember from OCS.
