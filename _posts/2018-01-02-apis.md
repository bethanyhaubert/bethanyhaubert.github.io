Yesterday was my first day back at work after a two-week holiday break. Will is currently working on implementing some additional reporting in our app. Right now, Dusty has to run a script every morning to import info from ChartMogul into Redshift. Will is trying to automate the whole process. I spent part of the day helping Will grab user info from the ChartMogul API. From there we were able to cross-reference _that_ info with our database's remote Braintree customer info to then attach the ChartMogul id to a user object directly. It was a pretty fun problem to solve. I do feel like there is room for some refinement. It'll be good to get a more experienced back-ender's eyes on it.
