#### These are a few of my very first Ruby errors and how I solved them:

1. ```syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end (SyntaxError)```

   - I was missing an `end`

2. ```in `require': cannot load such file -- dictionary.rb (LoadError)```

   - `require` only works if you've defined the proper scope of your project

3. ```in `require_relative': cannot load such file -- /Users/beth/Code/ruby-toy__string-segmentation/dictionary.rb (LoadError)```

   - I forgot to add the 'lib' directory to my file structure. I was using ../dictionary.rb instead of ../lib/dictionary.rb

4. ```undefined local variable or method `ilast_letter' for #<String...'```

   - I accidentally threw an extra character onto the beginning of my variable
