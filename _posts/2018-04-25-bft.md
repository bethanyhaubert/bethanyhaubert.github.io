This is my first week back at the office since my surgery. It's good to be back, but I miss my cats.

Today we started a new sprint and also a new feature. It's not super common for me to create new models and migrations, so every time I do it, it involves plenty of googling.

This model needed to be namespaced. I was curious to see if you namespace a new model from the command line and if the namespace folder would be created as well. It was actually pretty straight forward and it totally worked.

```ruby
rails g model PlatformUpgrades::UpgradeWindow capacity:int time_range:tsrange
```

There's now an `UpgradeWindow` model in the `platform_upgrades` folder!
