title: On diversity
---

Diversity & inclusivity in tech is not a topic that is new to me. Last year I worked with Big Omaha to adopt a Code of Conduct and incorporate a short intro on inclusivity in the opening remarks of the MC. I worked with 75 North to develop a summer coding camp for high schoolers from the 68111 zip code. 

As a new female developer, it concerns me that I may be passed up for opportunities and promotions simply because I'm a woman. A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/12/women-considered-better-coders-hide-gender-github">study</a> recently came out stating that while female coder's pull requests were accepted more often than men's when their gender was not identifiable in their profiles, but when they were easily identified as women, their code was less likely to be approved.
