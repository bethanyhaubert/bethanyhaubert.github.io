The past few days of getting my stories product-reviewed has been a major pain in the ass. None of our three staging environments has been kept up-to-date. Also, I found a pretty annoying bug when adding Simple SSL to a site still using the Flywheel temp domain. Who knows when that will get resolved...

On a positive note, I've moved two stories to 'done' today. Finally.
