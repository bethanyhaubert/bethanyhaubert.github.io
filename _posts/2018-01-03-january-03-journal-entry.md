To be honest, I'm still figuring it out. I've been tasked with producing training documents for new engineering hires that cover Github, Semaphore, and CodeClimate. Some new hires will to be seasoned developers. Some will be brand new. So how deep do I go? If they were hired as a software engineer, I'm assuming they know about version control, but what if they don't? I've had my own frustrations with more experienced devs taking their years of practical knowledge for granted and making assumptions about my level of proficiency.

I think it makes the most sense to teach new hires how _we_ use these integrations and let them dive deeper if needed, but we'll see. I might change my mind once I start digging in to the task further.
