Getting into the habit of writing these has been difficult. But, I'm going to keep at it. 

This morning I had coffee with a woman who's interested in applying for an software engineering role at Flywheel. Talking to other people about the company definitely reminds me to appreciate certain aspects of working here that other companies are lacking. That being said, we're not perfect. We definitely have our shortcomings. I felt almost apologetic as I was describing our team. No, there are no other women. No, there are no minorities. No, I'm the only junior dev. 

Since before I started working here, Flywheel has had a kind of privileged, white guy reputation among the women, minorities, and LGBTQIA folks that I know. I had hoped that was going to change. There is so much lip service to diversity in tech from the company heads, but nothing has changed on the engineering team. There have been excuses along the lines of 'But it's so hard to find experienced women'. 

Well then maybe we need to find more women and give them the experience they need.
