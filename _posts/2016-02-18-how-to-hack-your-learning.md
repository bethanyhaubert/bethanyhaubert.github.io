title: Hack your learning
---

The most beneficial hack I've implemented since class began is leaving for an hour to an hour and a half during lunch everyday. I'll go to the gym or grab lunch. It really clears my head and provides a clean slate when I start coding again. I can easily go for three or four hours straight after that break. I have a hard time focusing when there's a lot of activity so I also like to find a quiet place where people aren't moving around.
