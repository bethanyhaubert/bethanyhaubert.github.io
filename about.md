Hi. I'm Beth.

I'm a former Mandarin airborne cryptologic linguist, which is the reason I ended up moving to Nebraska a decade ago. I like traveling and I’m currently writing this intro on the train to Chicago. My favorite things are dinosaurs, cats, Battlestar Galactica, and cats.

I got out of the USAF in 2009 and went on to get my B.S. in Design from UNL. Consequently, I like making shit that’s functional and looks sweet. Up until recently, I was director of operations at Omaha Code School and Big Wheel Brigade. My most memorable project was producing and managing a summer-long coding camp for high schoolers from North Omaha. It was great, but exhausting.
